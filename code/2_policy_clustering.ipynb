         "Background and Aim: Health-promoting lifestyle (HPL) is one of the main criteria which determine health and underlying factors preventing the health-threatening factors. HPL includes six dimensions of spiritual growth, health responsibility, nutrition, stress management, interpersonal relations, and physical activity. Considering the importance of students’ health, both at individual and social levels, the present study was carried out to evaluate HPL among students (mainly females) of School of Health, affiliated to Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in 2014. Methods: In this cross-sectional descriptive study, 107 students of Mashhad School of Health using stratified random sampling were included. In order to collect data, Walker questionnaire, with a 4-point Likert scale, was utilized which included two sections of demographic questions, and questions related to the six dimensions of HPL. The collected data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and independent T-test, using SPSS version 11.5. The significance level was considered less than 0.05. Results: Lifestyle of 9.3%, 84.1%, and 6.5% of the students was poor, moderate and good, respectively. The mean scores of HPL dimensions were as follows: spiritual growth: 30.27±5.4, health responsibility: 32.15±6.5, nutrition: 15.65±4.06, stress management: 12.76±2.9, interpersonal relations: 21.34±4.35, and physical activity: 13.69±5.1. A significant relationship was seen between gender and physical activity (p <0.05). Conclusion: The majority of students had a moderate score of HPL. Since the lowest scores were related to physical activity and stress management, more facilities and training programs are required to improve these issues. It is recommended to provide high-quality healthcare services for students and raise their awareness about the benefits of physical activity via mass media.",

         "The number of informal caregivers for family members with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is rising dramatically in the United States. AD caregivers disproportionately experience numerous health problems and are often isolated with little support. An active lifestyle can help prevent and mitigate physical and psychological health concerns amongst AD caregivers. Research has demonstrated how pervasive exergames can encourage physical activity (PA) in the general population, yet little work has explored how these tools can address the significant PA barriers that AD caregivers face. To identify opportunities for design, we conducted semi-structured interviews and participatory design sessions with 14 informal caregivers of family members with AD. Our findings characterize how becoming an AD caregiver profoundly impacts one's ability to be active, perspectives on being active, and the ways that exergames might best support this population. We discuss implications for design and how our findings challenge existing technological approaches to PA promotion.",

         "Most trip generation models are insensitive to the effects of transportation demand management (TDM) strategies. To evaluate the potential effectiveness of TDM solutions, transportation professionals must rely largely on the results of case studies, which cannot be generalized for all urban areas. To evaluate TDM strategies in a context that is sensitive to the unique characteristics of each urban area, TDM strategies should be incorporated into regional travel demand models. Five TDM strategies affecting trip generation rates are examined: telecommunications, alternative work schedules, on-site amenities, pricing strategies, and land use strategies. To analyze these strategies, data from the Puget Sound Transportation Panel (PSTP) were used. Variables derived from the PSTP data that may help explain the impacts of these strategies were evaluated for significance in trip generation models for several home-based and non-home-based trip purposes. The trip generation models were specified using Poisson and negative binomial regression techniques. After the models were estimated, the significance of the variables representing the impacts of TDM strategies was analyzed. Many of the TDM variables were indeed significant in the trip generation models; however, in some cases, the significance of the variables can be attributed to factors such as trip chaining, which does not describe the effects of TDM strategies. Additional research is needed to fully determine the effects of trip chaining on the variables examined in this study, and additional data could enable the development of variables that more accurately describe the effects of TDM strategies.",

Multiple regression method was utilised for hypothesis testing. Attitude and perceived behavioural control showed significantly positive effects on intent to purchase activewear. Past activewear purchase behaviour and lifestyle orientation towards health and wellness help US consumers gain positive attitude towards shopping activewear for casual purpose.

         "Abstract The Indonesian government has a goal to reduce 834 million-tons CO2e emissions by 2030 with 314 million-tons CO2e portion coming from the energy sector. A significant contribution is required from all aspects of the energy sector, including Directional-Drilling (DD) &amp; Measurement/Logging-While-Drilling (M/LWD) activity which traditionally deploys human resources for field execution. With the governmentâ€™s increased hydrocarbon lifting target, an innovative approach is needed to keep the field carbon footprint low while still maintaining DD-M/LWD operational excellence. Performance-Live is a digitally collaborative service that enables live remote-control of wellsite operations to optimize task distribution between the well site and town thus boosting operational efficiency. As a solid foundation to execute these remote operations, highly skilled Performance-Live Engineers (PLE) are centralized in a Performance-Live Center, monitoring several rigs in parallel, while multiskilled DD-M/LWD Cross Trained (DDX) who are fully competent to handle both competencies are staffed at the well site. This collaboration can be seamlessly achievable by leveraging elevated digital peripheral systems such as advanced, automated internet technology and support centralized in the main Java island to enable robust connectivity. Flexible strategies for remote-operations implementation play a significant role in sustainability. In one of the land projects in Indonesia started from Q3 2020 until Q4 2021, 31 wells are drilled successfully using the Performance-Live service. This reduced headcount from 4 personnel to 3 personnel on board (POB) resulting estimated total of 3.52 metric tons of CO2 emission reduction. Another offshore pilot project in Indonesia for the one-month trial duration in 2021 with the same strategy resulted in the reduction of estimated 0.20 metric tons of CO2 emission. In one of the special projects in the same offshore area, an innovative open-hole drilling using Hydraulic Workover Unit (HWU) is implemented using Performance-Live and combined cabin container unit for DD-M/LWD-Mud Logging as full team collaboration. During this 5-months project, this single combined cabin unit enabled 4 field personnel reductions resulting estimated 4.01 metric tons of CO2 emission reduction. The continuity of this service in Indonesia can be potentially developed by further reduction from 3 to 2 POB (2x DDX with 2x PLE) which may result in double of the CO2 emission reduction, and a pre-prepared BHA model which will minimize POB rig days to reduce further estimated of 18% CO2 emission. This paper presents how the Performance-Live Remote-Operation model contributes to long-term sustainability goals, quantifies the amount of carbon footprint reduction, and speeds up the race toward net zero emissions future accomplishment in Indonesia. This paper will also present strategies for building a digital ecosystem for remote-operations implementation, challenges encountered, and optimization opportunities. DD-M/LWD remote-operations implementation in Indonesia has thus far been successful and will continue expanding to align with the governmentâ€™s net-zero goal.",

In recent decades, interest in preserving archaeological sites has increased dramatically. Many modern techniques have emerged from the different disciplines that can be used in preservation works, and a large number of the techniques and their capability made it difficult for decision-makers and specialists to determine the appropriate technique that gives the best results in preserving the archaeological site. The research aims to identify the project needed to preserve the archaeological site and then choose the appropriate technique for it, based on the opinions of experts using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, which helps decision-makers and specialists to choose the most appropriate technology. The archaeological site of Babylon was chosen as a case study. As a result of applying the AHP method, the priority weights of preservation stages for the archaeological site of Babylon were determined as follows: (diagnosis and monitoring 30.8 %), (intervention 21.2 %), and (tourism and media 16.6 %), while the appropriate technique was determined as follows: (infrared thermography 29.4 %), (maintenance 49.3 %), and (augmented reality 38.7 %).",

Without the utilization of renewable energy, the results of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are projected to increase until 2030 (IPCC 2014; IEA 2015), global energy demand is expected to double by 2050 compared to 1991 (World Energy Council 2013).

Indonesia is one of the countries that has implemented it, also in South Sulawesi recently, namely in Sidrap and Jeneponto Regencies with a capacity of 75 MW and 72 MW respectively. The problem that arises is that the MNC that runs it has asked for an increase in PLN's purchase price for the wind power it produces, but the Government has not granted it, while as many as six million people in Indonesia who still lack access to electricity, especially in remote rural areas, are predicted to see an increase in demand for electricity of around 10% each year. The solution to this is the implementation of several things including the need for Government Policy in considering the economics of wind power plants, namely by making a Law on Renewable Energy including wind power and making a Presidential Regulation on the price of electricity purchased by PLN from companies that produce Renewable Energy including wind power; Transition in Government Practices and Community Institutions for the sustainable progress of humanity and the utilization of technological advances, especially the Internet of Things in Indonesia to help accelerate the implementation of wind power in Indonesia.",

It is therefore worth studying which additional elements underpinned purchases abroad. Takeaways •Energy market tensions caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine boosted energy imports, due to stockpiling strategies against possible supply problems and for re-export to other EU countries. •Imports of goods with energy-intensive productive processes appear to have benefited from the loss of competitiveness of domestic production resulting from higher energy commodity prices. •The strong import growth also seems to have stemmed from the shift in industrial production towards sectors with a higher import content, the demand for which would have increased due to changes in habits in the wake of the pandemic (e.g. pharmaceuticals, IT and telecommunications) and the recovery in mobility (e.g. textiles).",

The State interest has too often been expressed as an extension of the policies of the State and Central Govt. which usually focus on exploitation of these forests for the overall development of the State, as a result of which the local communities which inhabit the forest under exploitation are marginalized. Participatory Forest Management got its formal shape in the year 1990. A need has arise to evaluate the impact of this management tool. 58 VFCs are functioning both with the Social Forestry projects and the territorial wings of the forest departments for the rehabilitation of the forest land of Kupwara District. A study was taken up in Shumeriyal and Doban Village committees to assess the impact of Joint Forest Management on the socio-economic development of rural people and to identify the prime ingredients of this programme responsible for bringing about the desired change. It was observed that the household income has considerable increased due to alternative job opportunities, agriculture production has increased, reduction in distance travelled and time spent for fuelwood and fodder collection and institution building and other constructions (Entry point activities) has paved the way for sustainability of the whole process. For the present study, the two VFCs selected, one VFC (Shumeriyal) which is only 6 kms from the district headquarter Kupwara having the population of 5800 souls and the another VFC (Doban) which is near about 60 kms away from the district headquarter having population of 2740 souls. During the present study it was observed that the Shumeriyal village is more developed than that of Doban village due to proper transport facilities, communication facilities, land productivity, drainage system, education and employment, During the present study it was observed that the forest villages which are near to the District headquarter are well developed than those areas which are far beyond the District headquarter.",

         "Purpose: With the aging of the population and the development of information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure and education systems, methods to maintain social networks among the older adults are attracting attention. In this study, familiar leisure activities were introduced into the process of learning how to use devices, as anxiety about using devices has been considered one of the factors that hinder the spread of ICT among older adults. This study aimed to explore the effects of an ICT utilization program on device use anxiety and health-related quality of life quality and how ICT use affects social participation. Participants and Methods: Twenty-two community-dwelling older adults participated in a social network service group exchange for 1 month, and a questionnaire survey was conducted on ICT utilization and WHO-5 before and after the program. From the survey, we examined the effects of ICT use on older adults anxiety about device use and life satisfaction. Results: Before and after the program, a change in the WHO-5 total score and anxiety about using a device was found. In addition, not only positive opinions were heard regarding the impressions of the program, but many wished to continue the program in the future. Conclusion: In this study, we confirmed that a style in which participants naturally learn how to use a device while interacting with each other based on themes that include elements of enjoyment leads to a reduction in anxiety about device use and increase the degree of satisfaction.",

To address this research gap, this study advances our understanding by assessing the effect of city–to–city transportation on haze pollution caused by the operation of high-speed rail, which triggers the rapid flow of individuals and information, improves information transparency, as well as imposes institutional pressure on local governments and firms to reduce haze pollution. To further verify the underlying mechanisms, we tested the development of hard infrastructure (information communication technology) and soft infrastructure (market development level), which represent two conditions for which the mechanism is likely to be critical. We tested our hypotheses using a sample of 288 prefecture-level cities in China during the period from 2005 to 2016. The empirical results indicate that the operation of high-speed rail can reduce haze pollution by 17% on average.",

This has also highlighted another dependency – that on raw materials that are critical for the EU’s transition to a low-carbon economy. A strategic approach to raw material management can help negate the risks posed by a dependency on imports of critical raw materials. Improving resource efficiency is also necessary to achieve a low-carbon economy and sustain socio-economic progress in the face of finite natural resources. This Forum highlights the progress currently being made in geopolitical, economic and environmental areas and looks at the main constraints to the circular economy agenda where targeted solutions are needed. What is currently being done to decouple material consumption from welfare creation and use resources more efficiently? To what extent can recycling prolong the use of natural resources? Which measures can transform current business models into circular business models? How can technology and digitalisation be used to improve resource efficiency while minimising environmental burdens? Can knowledge transfer be used in addressing the complexity of the transition to a circular economy?",

Brazilians have unhealthier food consumption habits than OECD countries, while the prevalence of insufficient physical activity has increased more rapidly in Brazil than elsewhere over the past decades. Brazil has started to address the issue of overweight in a number of policies and interventions, including a food labelling scheme and school-based policies such as the Programa Saúde na Escola. While these are valuable strategies, Brazil could aim for a more ambitious multi-sectoral and comprehensive response. Brazil should better influence lifestyles through information and education programmes such as introducing menu labelling in restaurants, mass media campaigns, and promoting prescription of physical activity by family health teams. Brazil should also pursue food reformulation more actively, developing workplace or transport policies, while regulating food and beverage advertising particularly for children.",

         "Overweight is a growing public health challenge in Brazil, with over half of the population overweight in 2016. Brazilians have unhealthier food consumption habits than OECD countries, while the prevalence of insufficient physical activity has increased more rapidly in Brazil than elsewhere over the past decades. Brazil has started to address the issue of overweight in a number of policies and interventions, including a food labelling scheme and school-based policies such as the Programa Saúde na Escola. While these are valuable strategies, Brazil could aim for a more ambitious multi-sectoral and comprehensive response. Brazil should better influence lifestyles through information and education programmes such as introducing menu labelling in restaurants, mass media campaigns, and promoting prescription of physical activity by family health teams. Brazil should also pursue food reformulation more actively, developing workplace or transport policies, while regulating food and beverage advertising particularly for children.",

In this paper, we emphasized on energy efficiency (EE) for cloud radio access network (C-RAN) architecture in the context of 5G cellular networks with hybrid supply. The intermittent nature of PV generation is counter balanced by the DG supply which has emerged as a promising option for energy sustainability. The prime aim is to maximum utilization of green energy harvested from installed PV panels for greener the envisioned network. In addition, the environmental effect such as carbon footprint has been comprehensively analyzed by varying solar capacity. An extensive simulation has been carried out for evaluating EE performance of the proposed network varying different system parameters such as transmission power, solar module capacity in consideration of the real traffic demand. Numerical results justify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

Healthy Respect 2 (HR2) combined sex education with youth-friendly sexual health services, media campaigns and branding, and encouraged joint working between health services, local government and the voluntary sector. This study examined whether HR2: (1) improved young people's sexual health knowledge, attitudes, behaviour and use of sexual health services and (2) reduced socioeconomic inequalities in sexual health.A quasi-experiment in which the intervention and comparison areas were matched for teenage pregnancy and terminations, and schools were matched by social deprivation. 5283 pupils aged 15-16 years (2269 intervention, 3014 comparison) were recruited to cross-sectional surveys in 2007, 2008 and 2009.The intervention improved males' and, to a lesser extent, females' sexual health knowledge. Males' intention to use condoms, and reported use of condoms, was unaffected, compared with a reduction in both among males in the comparison arm. Although females exposed to the intervention became less accepting of condoms, there was no change in their intention to use condoms and reported condom use. Pupils became more tolerant of sexual coercion in both the intervention and comparison arms. Attitudes towards same-sex relationships remained largely unaffected. More pupils in the HR2 area used sexual health services, including those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. This aside, sexual health inequalities remained.Combining school-based sex education and sexual health clinics has a limited impact. Interventions that address the upstream causes of poor sexual health, such as a detrimental sociocultural environment, represent promising alternatives. These should prioritise the most vulnerable young people.",

The study found a positive link between infrastructure and inclusive growth. These results were significant for energy, transport and information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructures. It was also found that poorer people gain more benefits from the listed infrastructures than the rich, which shows that infrastructure plays an important role in the distribution of income.

         "Contemporary business models need to re-imagine the production and distribution of goods and services embedding social, economic, and environmental goals concurrently. To this end, reverse logistics in streamlining a circular economy (take, make, use, reuse, repair, and recycle) catapulted to the top of the discussion for collecting and distributing products. Yet, little is empirically known about the role of reverse logistics in the circular economy. This study attempts to fill this knowledge gap in theory and practice through a multiple case study approach including 40 semi-structured interviews with reverse logistics specialists from the four largest retailing firms in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Findings reveal multiple ways by which reverse logistics contributes to a circular economy: for instance, reverse logistics enables firms to develop a circular product design; the combination of reverse flow with the forward flow consolidates the high volume of products, thus mitigating waste; use of innovative tools (robots, autonomous bikes) in reverse logistics increases the used products' return rate and thereby enhancing recycling; technological advances (e.g. big data and IoT) in reverse logistics help trace the product thus reducing waste. The paper offers several valuable insights for practitioners to build a circular economy via reverse logistics (waste reduction, responsible consumption, and sustainable logistics). Our study also contributes to multiple United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 11, SDG 12, and SDG 13).",
